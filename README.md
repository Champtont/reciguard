react app that saves user recipes and so much more!

## The Why:

My wife has been a huge support and source of encouragement during this Bootcamp for me. She has overseen all of my progress and reminded me of every tiny step that I had taken when I forgot about or was incapable of seeing my progress. This idea comes from her. She loves to cook and requested that I build an app that allows her to save and edit her recipes. She challenges me and provides new ideas for features almost daily. I will do my best to achieve each of the features that she asked of me while also providing a good user experience that keeps accessiblity in mind and a mobile-first approach.

## Features Include:

-- User can log In/Out
-- User has the option to logIn using Googles OAuth
-- User can edit their user info
-- User can change their avatar
-- User can save/edit/delete their own recipes (including a photo).

-- User will have a calendar that can hold recipes and create a shopping list regaurding a selected time range.

-- User can edit the shoping list
