react app that saves user recipes and so much more!

## The Why:

My wife has been a huge support and source of encouragement during this Bootcamp for me. She has overseen all of my progress and reminded me of every tiny step that I had taken when I forgot or was incapable of seeing my progress. This idea comes from her. She loves to cook and requested that I build an app that allows her to save and edit her recipes. She challenges me and provides new ideas for features almost daily. I will do my best to achieve each of the features that she asked of me while also providing a good user experience that keeps accessiblity in mind and a mobile-first approach.
