# Reciguard
Our food is generational and tells stories of it's own. Many of us will say that there's no cooking like grandmas' cooking and she either had a physical recipe book or memorized all of her recipes. Todays world is a technological and social one. So, recipes are shared amongst friends and family and transformed when people would like to put their own twist on a recipe, adding to an already long and complex story. That's where Reciguard comes in. Reciguard is a single page react app (SPA) that is a modern day personal recipe book. We say that an elephant never forgets, so save your recipes with the green elephant and worry no more! Preserve your culinary history or add to your culinary future... This app can help you to save/edit your recipes... or adapt someone elses to your tastes. Reciguard can help with meal planning for the month. Furthermore, It can help you to create a shopping list from menus that are within a specified date range. Keep the history alive and build your profile today!  

## The Why:

My wife has been a huge support and source of encouragement during Epicode Bootcamp for me. She has overseen all of my progress and reminded me of every tiny step that I had taken when I forgot or was incapable of seeing my progress. This idea comes from her, so I dedicate my capstone project to her. She loves to cook and requested that I build an app that allows her to save and edit her recipes. She challenges me and provides new ideas for features almost daily. I will do my best to achieve each of the features that she asked of me while also providing a good user experience that keeps accessiblity in mind and a mobile-first approach.
